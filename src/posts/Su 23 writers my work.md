### POETRY
INFLATION AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP

#### OUR ANTHEM
```
Arise O Compatriots! We have to obey the call.
But how can we, when all we do is struggle,
Our young children are protected from reality,
But now the rain of life has fallen and we fear what is beneath every puddle.
Reality has ganged up on us and now garri is our last resort in the trenches.
We grew up caged and unaware trying to understand what the trench is.
Oh how the days of 10k for a bag of rice are missed. 
We fought over three sardines in our can now all we see is one.
Here we sit in our vault of thoughts, 
Trying to figure out who is at fault.
Who comes to mind?.......ah! Yes! The Government.
They have been tagged the enemy to us Nigerian men and women.
But why don’t we blame the danfo driver that adds 100 Naira to his fare, 
Once the ugly face of fuel scarcity shows it’s face.
Or the POS woman that adds 200 to her charges,
And goes around saying there’s no cash,
There’s no food, there’s no money, are the claims of these voices,
Is it true? Is it false? Or is it just the way of the masses?
They say our vote is our voice,
We go around chanting, but in our hearts we ask at what cost?
```
```
O God of creation, direction is what we ask for,
Hmmm…… Do we really want to know the way to go?
Or do we just want someone to follow?
Oh how this Nation is blessed with treasures, 
But we all choose to pursue pleasures.
Choice Oh Choice!, how freely it is given to us,
The choice to work and fight for what is truly ours.
To stay and win before it’s too late.
To spam our online groups with messages of redemption,
And share posts until that vision is trending.
To spread hope and joy amidst the pain and struggle,
Because we are Nigeria!
From the masses to the elite, we forge our fate.
Yes! We can raise the value of the Naira.
And build a Nigeria of love, strength and power.
We create what we say is possible.
And unite every generation because this Nigeria is able.
We are the Government, we are the Children.
We are the Parents, we are the Students.
We are the Elites, we are the Masses.
We are Possibility and we are the Hope of Nigeria.
